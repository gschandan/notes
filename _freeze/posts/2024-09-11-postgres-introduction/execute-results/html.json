Hierarchical e.g. IMS (IBM) - each record composed of other records - efficient storage for particular questions  \n2. Network Database Model - records can contain references to other records via pointers - end up with a linked list - difficult to maintain pointers, and queries need to follow the linked lists  \n3. Relational models (used in RDMSs) - emphasis on data integrity  \n   - records are called tuples - an ordered group of components or attributes which each have a defined type  \n   - typles are ordered, there cannot be duplicates, and attributes must be atomic i.e. a single piece of data  \n   - the attribute(s) used to differentiate a record from another are usually the primary key  \n  \n## Language\n  \nSQL (Structured Query Language):   \n- current standard is SQL:2023  \n- three types of commands:  \n  - DML (Data Manipulation Language) e.g. inserting/updating/deleting\n  - DDL (Data Definition Language) e.g. creating tables/altering the structure or relationships of tables\n  - DCL (Data Control Language) e.g.granting permissions or access\n\n## Responsibilities of an (R)DBMS\n- Management and storage of the database(s)  \n- Query facilities  \n- Concurrent use \n- Auditing/Logging - for auditing, investigation and restoration  \n- Security and access management  \n- Maintain referential integrity  \n\n## PostgreSQL\n\nA relational DBMS that supports SQL \n\n\n## References\n\n[^1] Beginning Databases with PostgreSQL\n\n",
