A number multiplied by its reciprocal or inverse always returns 1 e.g. \\frac{1}{5} * 5 = 1. Similarly, a matrix multiplied by its inverse, will return the identity matrix.\n\n\n\n\nUsed to computationally solve linear equations. Matrix inverse is denoted \\boldsymbol{X}^{-1}.

This avoids overdetermination (rows &gt; cols) i.e. number of equations &gt; number of dimensions (multiple points of overlap), and underdetermination (rows &lt; cols) i.e. number of equations are less than dimensions (no overlap as single line) - may still be able to solve these, but can’t invert a matrix as a solution.\n\n\n\n\\begin{bmatrix} y{_1} \\\\ y{_2} \\\\ \\vdots \\\\ y{_n}\\end{bmatrix} =\\begin{bmatrix} 1 & X_{1,1} & X_{1,2} & \\dots & X_{1,m_{-1}}\\\\ 1 & X_{2,1} & X_{2,2} & \\dots & X_{2,m_{-1}} \\\\ \\vdots \\\\ 1 & X_{n,1} & X_{n,2} & \\dots & X_{n,m_{-1}} \\end{bmatrix}\n\\begin{bmatrix} \\alpha \\\\ \\beta \\\\ \\vdots \\\\ m_{-1}\\end{bmatrix}\n Would like to solve for the vector of variables on the right, in this regression model.

If it is square, denoted as diag(\\boldsymbol{x}) where \\boldsymbol{x} is a vector of main diagonal elements e.g. [1,1,1] to represent \\boldsymbol{I}_3. Much more computationally efficient: - Multiplication: diag(\\boldsymbol{x})\\boldsymbol{y} = \\boldsymbol{x}\\odot{}\\boldsymbol{y} - Inversion: $diag()^{-1} = diag(,,)^T $ - Can’t divide by zero, so if any elemenet along the diagonal contains zero, the diagonal can’t be inverted - Can be non-square and computation can still be efficient e.g. by adding zeros to the product if height &gt; width, or by removing elements from the product if the width &gt; height\n\n\n\nIn orthogonal matrices, orthonormal vectors make up all rows and columns. This means that \\boldsymbol{A}^{T} \\boldsymbol{A} = \\boldsymbol{A}\\boldsymbol{A}^{T} = \\boldsymbol{I} and also that \\boldsymbol{A}^{T} = \\boldsymbol{A}^{-1}\\boldsymbol{I} = \\boldsymbol{A}^{-1}. Calculating \\boldsymbol{A}^{T} is cheap, and therefore so is \\boldsymbol{A}^{-1} for orthogonal matrices."

    "section": "",
    "text": "For classifiers that calculate distances between points, e.g. Euclidean kNN or SVM, one feature can dominate the others purely due to scale when proportional contributions of all the features are wanted. Feature scaling (particularly standardisation) can also increase the convergence speed of gradient descent algorithms by altering the step size for each feature. Tree based algorithms and others (e.g. NB, LDA) are insensitive to the scale of the features as the decision to split at that node is not influenced by other features, rather the decision to split is usually based on what will decrease the variance or increase the homogeneity in the sub-nodes.\nGenerally, normalisation is applied when the distribution of the data is known to not be gaussian, e.g. for algorithms that do not presume a distribution e.g. kNN. It is important to consider outliers as normalising data with outliers will scale potentially important features into a small interval, so they must be handled first.\n\n\n\nPrevents the scale of the variable from over-influencing the model due to unit difference\nScale features or variables to a common scale without distortion of differences in the range\n\ne.g. [0,1]\n\nExamples\n\nRescaling (min-max normalisation) to a range of [0,1] or [-1,-1] or [a,b]\n\nx'= \\frac {x-min(x)} {max(x)-min(x)}\nx'= \\frac {(x-min(x))(b-a)} {max(x)-min(x)}\n\nMean normalisation\n\nx'= \\frac {x-average(x)} {max(x)-min(x)}\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nStandardise to find out how many standard deviations the values have from the mean\nStandardisation will scale the data to have a mean of 0 and standard deviation of 1\nNo specific upper or lower bound of values\nMethods:\n\nZ-Score: for population mean and std.dev.\n\n\\LARGE z = \\frac{x - \\mu}{\\sigma}\n\nZ-Score (estimated): for sample mean and std.dev.(\\large S)\n\n\\LARGE z = \\frac{x - \\bar x}{S}\n\n\nUsages:\n\nStandardising regression coefficients\nStandardising variables prior to PCA\n\n\n\n\n\n\nScale the components of a feature vector such that the overall vector has length 1\ne.g. dividing by the Euclidean length of the vector\n\\large x'= \\frac {x} {||x||}\n\n\n\n\n\nWikipedia - Feature Scaling\nKDNuggets - Feature Scaling"

Typically, the data is split into a training set and testing set (80-20 or 70-30 etc.), or a training, testing and validation set. Cross-Validation can be particularly helpful for smaller datasets, helping to avoid over-fitting and hyperparameter tuning.\n\n\nDataset used to create a model to be used for predictions. The model can then be applied to the training data sets to assess the accuracy of predictions against labelled data. The model can then be tuned if necessary.\n\n\n\nThe model can then be applied to a testing set, data which has not been used to make the model, from which an error rate can be estimated (generalisation error).\nIf the training set error rate is low and the testing set error rate is high, it suggests the model has been over-fitted to the training data set.\n\n\n\nAnother holdout dataset can be used is the validation set. It provides an unbiased estimation of the performance of the model which can be useful when assessing multiple models to minimise over-fitting. Multiple models can be trained with different hyperparameters, and evaluated against the validation set, with the best performing hyperparameters and model being used on the test dataset to estimate the generalisation error. They can also be used to stop training early on a model where the error on the validation set increases beyond a specified limit.\n\n\n\nIf the dataset size is relatively smaller to begin with, to avoid issues with trying to train a model on less data, cross-validation can be used.

    "text": "Linear algebra deals with linear equations (no polynomial terms). However, it can still be used for approximations for non-linear systems. Uses in ML include solving for unknowns e.g. deep learning, dimensionality reduction e.g. PCA, ranking e.g. eigenvectors, associated recommendations and NLP e.g. SVD or matrix factorisation.\nAn example linear equation with many unknowns in a regression model of house prices:\n\\large y = \\alpha + \\beta x{_1} + \\gamma x{_2} + ... + mx{_m}\ny = price, \\alpha = y-intercept, \\beta = number of rooms, \\gamma = area, x = feature\nWhen dealing with linear systems of equations, there can only be three types of solutions, none, one or infinite. Plotting the equations, if the lines are parallel, they will never intersect i.e. no solution, if the lines are overlapping, there are infinite solutions, else the lines will intersect at one point only (it is impossible for straight lines to intersect multiple times).\nUsing the house price regression model, we will have as many rows(n) of these equations as we have house prices, each with its m_{-1} features(x) (m-1 due to alpha), and m+1 unknowns(\\alpha,\\beta, \\gamma) which is what we want to solve for:\n y = \\alpha + \\beta x{_1} + \\gamma x{_2} + ... + m_{-1}x_{m_{-1}} \n\n\\begin{bmatrix}\ny{_1} |\\alpha + \\beta x{_{1,1}} + \\gamma x{_{1,2}} + ... + m_{-1}x{_{1,m_{-1}}} \\\\\ny{_2} | \\alpha + \\beta x{_{2,1}} + \\gamma x{_{2,2}} + ... + m_{-1}x{_{2,m_{-1}}} \\\\\n\\dots \\\\\ny{_n} |  \\alpha + \\beta x{_{n,1}} + \\gamma x{_{n,2}} + ... + m_{-1}x{_{n,m_{-1}}}\n\\end{bmatrix}\n\nThis is a set (denoted by square brackets) of linear equations.\n\n\nTensors are a generalisation of vectors and matrices to any number of dimensions.\n\n\n\nDimension\nName\nDescription\n\n\n\n\n0\nScalar\nmagnitude (value)\n\n\n1\nVector\narray\n\n\n2\nMatrix\n2d array (square)\n\n\n3\n3-Tensor\n3d array (cube)\n\n\nn\nn-Tensor\nmultidimensional\n\n\n\n\n\nSingle value, no dimensions, denoted by lower case italic variable names e.g. x\n\n\n\n1-Dimensional ordered array of values, lower case bold italic name e.g. \\large \\boldsymbol{x}\nElements are scalars, denoted non-bold lower case x with their index e.g. x{_1}\n\n\n\\begin{bmatrix} x{_1} & x{_2} & x{_3} \\end{bmatrix}{^T} = $\n\\begin{bmatrix}\nx{_1} \\\\\nx{_2} \\\\\nx{_3}\n\\end{bmatrix}\n$\nRow vector of shape (1,3) transposed to a column vector shape (3,1).\n\n\n\nNorms are functions that quantify vector magnitude (length).\n\\begin{bmatrix}  x{_1} & x{_2} \\end{bmatrix} = \\begin{bmatrix}  5 & 7 \\end{bmatrix} also represents a magnitude and direction from the origin.\n\\large L{^2} Norm ||\\boldsymbol{x}||{_2} = \\sqrt{\\sum_{\\substack{i}}x{_i}{^2}}\nSquare each element in the vector, sum them, then take the square root.

    "text": "Generally, compilers transform source code from the source language to the target language, usually to create an executable program, whereas program synthesisers search for a program that will satisfy some stated requirements. They both take high-level specifications to generate software, but synthesisers can search over a solution space to discover how to generate a program to satisfy the requirements (some compiler optimisations also do this e.g. autotuning). A program in this context, is a description of how to perform a computation. It is useful to constrain the solution to narrower notation than programming languages such as Domain Specific Languages (DSL) to avoid using specific constructs, rather build using a limited set of functions. Functional programming notation is useful for synthesis as we avoid side effects which can simplify the reasoning process, and can be expressed concisely.\n## Synthesis Program synthesis will generate a program that will solve the stated problem, within a specified program solution space i.e. with control over the space of programs, not just the intended behaviour. An example is flash fill (Excel) which derives and applies a small program to the rest of the data. The order can also be rveersed e.g. start with a program and search for the specification i.e. reverse engineering e.g. Verified Lifting - discovering a high level representation that is provably equivalent to an implementation which can then be uo generate a more efficient version of the program. There are 3 major challenges; intention, invention and adaptation to consider.\n\n\n\nSemantic and syntactic constraints: form of user input will influence the synthesis system e.g. input-output examples like flash fill may not be suitable. May need a multimodal approach with some examples or abstract examples combined with logical specifications, to provide enough data about intended behaviour.\nUnder specification: if there are multiple solutions that satisfy requirements, which one should be chosen?\n\n\n\n\n\nDiscovering the code to satisfy the requirements\n\n\n\n\n\nThe application of synthesis to broader software development e.g. bug fixing, optimisation and other maintenance or existing codebase tasks.\n\n\n\n\n\nInductive synthesis generates a function that matches provided input-output examples. ### Programming by example (PBE) and Programming by demonstration (PBD) In PBE, just the input-output is provided, which can leave a large potential solution space e.g. f(1) = 1 which could be addition, division, multiplication etc.\nIn PBD, a trace of the computation performed is also provided to provide additional specification which makes it easier to infer the intended program, e.g. f(1) = 1 \\times 1 = 1\nPBD and PBE can still be under-specificed with a large solution program space; need to address how to find the program that matches the observations, and how to know that the program that the user required is the one that was found. Arbritrary spaces can also be searched e.g. a large but highly constrained space, allowing exclusion of undesirable solutions, but would still likely require ranking of solutions.\n\n\n\nNeed to represent code as a data structure - Abstrac Syntax Trees (AST) are commonly used for this as they usually follow the same structure of the parse tree of the program, whilst ignoring additional characters e.g. parentheses, hence abstract. Context free grammar notation is often used to describe ASTs, to represent the structure of DSLs.\n\n\n\n\n\nExplicitly construct programs until one satisfies the observations, ideally avoiding the generation of programs that are not viable e.g. cannot satisfy the observations or can be proven redundant from existing found solutions.\n- Bottom-Up: discover low level components then ho to assemble them into programs i.e. leaf nodes up.\n- Top-Down: discover the high level structure first, then enumerate to the low level components i.e. root down.\nThe synthesiser will maintain a partial or completely constructed program that is being evaluated e.g. would evaluate potential solutions until success.\n\n\n\nIn symbolic searching, the synthesiser will maintain a symbolic representation of the space of all programs that are considered valid e.g. Version Space Algebras and Constraint Systems.\nA symbolic search may perform some algebraeic manipulation to deduce results which may perform better in some cases, but not all e.g. binary search being effective in finding solutions where algebraeic manipulation may be too costly.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOne way to simplify the solution space is to define or use a small DSL, then consider all possible valid programs within this language, using context free grammar to describe the ASTs. This makes it simple to enumerate all (or randomly sample) programs in a small DSL. If the DSL has a type system, this can help eliminate solutions which violate type rules. ### Constraint Based Constraint based approaches utilise parametric representations of the space - different choices of paramters correspond to different forms of the program. Paramtetric representations can be more general than grammars - grammars can be encoded in paramteric representation provided a boundary on the length of the program. Paramteric programs can also be referred to as generative models, particularly when the free parameter choice is associated with probabilities. ### Symmetry If there are many ways to represent the same program, the program space has lots of symmetry. Symmetry can be reduced with reduction of cummtativity e.g. forcing right or left associativity. Constraint and enumeration based strategies can benefit from symmetry reduction, though there are additional techniques that are mostly removed from this issue. For example $expr := var N | expr + expr $ has a greater soltuion space than $expr := var N | (var * N) + expr $ which forces right associativity."

    "text": "A simple implementation would be to construct all possible programs from the terminals of a grammar. This can be inefficient as the space of all expressions can grow quickly.

Then the programs can be combined. #### Anti/Unification If there are no top-level branches to allow unification, antiunification can be used. Unification is finding a common structure for two different expressions by replacing variables with expressions. Antiunification is to process of finding the common structure by replacing expressions with variables. For example, if we find 2 expressions a \\times c and b \\times c cover all inputs, antiunification can produce a common expression v \\times c where v stands for a code fragment that can be solved, being a much smaller synthesis problem. When a recursive call to STUN is made, additional constraints can also be passed that the expression must satisfy to avoid situations where, for example, anntiunification cannot be used e.g. b \\times c would be chosen over -b as b \\times c can be antiunified with a \\times c. \\bigoplus represents unification.\n\n\n\nModularisation may also be performed if the program can be split into different levels of abstraction, and the search performed independently at each level.

A basic algorithm will start from the grammar rules and test with the inputs, pruning out programs that are fully expanded which don’t return the correct output or which return incompatible types. Some languages will have infinite types, e.g. for supporting nested lists and functions. Typing rules have the following form:  \\frac{premises}{context ⊢ expr : \\tau }  ⊢ = proves or satisfies or is derived or assuming expr will have type \\tau in a given context as long as all the premises are satisfied. Alternatively:  \\frac{conditions}{Examples, ⊢ expression : \\tau } \nAn example typing rule might be:  \\frac{\\bold{\\textit C},x : \\tau_1 ⊢ expr : \\tau_2}{\\bold{\\textit C} ⊢ \\bold{\\lambda}x.expr : \\tau_1 \\to \\tau_2 }  states the following: \\bold{\\lambda}x.expr will have type \\tau_1 \\to \\tau_2 if it can be shown that expr has type \\tau_2 in a context that is like the context \\bold{\\textit C} but that also has x as having type \\tau_1.\nThe search space can also be further restricted in further iterations/generations for functions like map; if the expected output is an array of integer arrays, the first expression must correspond to a function with a type of integer array, allowing filtering of programs that won’t have the desired type before evaluating any concrete input values.\n\n\nType rules are a form of deductive rule; information about inputs/outputs are propogated to potential sub-expressions. Additional rules for different constructs in the language can prune the solution space.

Rules can inform the search if a candidate is not going to work e.g. map will always return a list of the same length so if the input length is different, map alone will not be viable.
