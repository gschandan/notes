## Introduction

Data structures provide an organised format for data storage, management and access.
Most of the following data structures are used in four basic ways:  
1. Access - provided a location, return the item at that location, or alternatively, return all the items
2. Search - look for a specific item or value, and it's location
3. Insert - add an item into the collection
4. Delete - remove an item from the collection

Transformations like sorting and filtering can also be performed. 
The following are some common and basic data structures:

### Array

Arrays are collections of items, generally stored in contiguous memory:
| Index | 0 | 1 | 2 | 3 | 4 |
|-------|---|---|---|---|---|
| Value | 'h' | 'e' | 'l' | 'l' | 'o' |


Access: $O(1)$  
Search: $O(n)$  
Insertion: $O(n)$  
Deletion: $O(n)$
