# Types

Common taxonomy of data types when considering machine learning

- **Categorical**: _qualitative_

  - _Ordinal_: innate ordered values with unknown distances between them that cannot be measured
    - e.g. first/second/third, good/bad
  - _Nominal_: values (text or numbers) with no order
    - e.g. cat/dog, genre, ethnicity

- **Numerical**: _quantitative_
  - Discrete: quantitative whole number values
    - e.g. step count
  - Continuous: quantitative decimal values
    - e.g. width, height

# Quality

- Training data should be _representative_ of the data that will be predicted with
- _Sampling noise_: small sample leads to models that provide imprecise predictions due to chance [^1]
- _Sampling bias_: data in the sample may have a higher or lower probability of occurring compared to the original data
- Discard outliers
- Ignore or impute missing values, or train models with and without those values and compare their performances
- _Feature engineering_ - feature selection (useful data), feature extraction (combining features to make more useful ones, e.g. dimensionality reduction), feature creation (new data)

# Quantity

- More data supplied to simple algorithms can perform better than complex algorithms trained on smaller datasets
- Trade off- cost of acquiring and storing more data vs tuning algorithms
